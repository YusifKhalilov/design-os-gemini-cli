You are helping redesign a specific component. This can be run at any time after Step 5.

## Step 1: Identify Component

"Which component would you like to redesign?

List current components in `product/components/`:
[List all .svelte files]

Enter the component name (e.g., Button, Card):"

## Step 2: Understand the Problem

"What's wrong with **[component]**?

A. It doesn't match the overall style
B. I want to try a different layout
C. The colors don't feel right
D. It needs more visual interest
E. Something else (describe)"

## Step 3: Propose Variations

Based on feedback, propose 3 variations:

"Here are 3 variations for **[component]**:

**Variation A: [name]**
[Description of changes]

**Variation B: [name]**
[Description of changes]

**Variation C: [name]**
[Description of changes]

Which do you prefer? (A, B, C, or describe what you want)"

## Step 4: Apply Changes

Update the component file with chosen variation.

Show the changes:
"Updated **[component]**:

Changes made:
- [change 1]
- [change 2]
- [change 3]

Preview in the app to see the result."

## Step 5: Iterate or Complete

"Happy with the redesign?
- Yes → Done!
- No → Tell me what else to change"
