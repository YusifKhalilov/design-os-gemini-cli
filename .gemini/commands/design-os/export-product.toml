# Export Product

You are helping the user export their complete product design as a handoff package for implementation. This generates all files needed to build the product in a real codebase.

## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

Verify the minimum requirements exist:

**Required:**
- `/product/product-overview.md` — Product overview
- `/product/product-roadmap.md` — Sections defined
- At least one section with screen designs in `src/sections/[section-id]/`

**Recommended (show warning if missing):**
- `/product/data-model/data-model.md` — Global data model
- `/product/design-system/colors.json` — Color tokens
- `/product/design-system/typography.json` — Typography tokens
- `src/shell/components/AppShell.tsx` — Application shell

If required files are missing:
"To export your product, you need at minimum:
- A product overview (`/design-os:product-vision`)
- A roadmap with sections (`/design-os:product-roadmap`)
- At least one section with screen designs

Please complete these first."

Stop here if required files are missing.

If recommended files are missing, show warnings but continue.

## Step 2: Gather Export Information

Read all relevant files:
1. `/product/product-overview.md` — Product name, description, features
2. `/product/product-roadmap.md` — List of sections in order
3. `/product/data-model/data-model.md` (if exists)
4. `/product/design-system/colors.json` (if exists)
5. `/product/design-system/typography.json` (if exists)
6. `/product/shell/spec.md` (if exists)
7. For each section: `spec.md`, `data.json`, `types.ts`
8. List screen design components in `src/sections/` and `src/shell/`

## Step 3: Create Export Directory Structure

Create the `product-plan/` directory with this structure:

product-plan/
├── README.md                    # Quick start guide
├── product-overview.md          # Product summary
├── prompts/                     # Ready-to-use prompts for coding agents
│   ├── one-shot-prompt.md       # Prompt for full implementation
│   └── section-prompt.md        # Prompt template for section-by-section
├── instructions/                # Implementation instructions
│   ├── one-shot-instructions.md # All milestones combined
│   └── incremental/             # For milestone-by-milestone implementation
│       ├── 01-foundation.md
│       ├── 02-[first-section].md
│       └── ...
├── design-system/               # Design tokens
├── data-model/                  # Data model
├── shell/                       # Shell components
└── sections/                    # Section components

## Step 4: Generate Files

Generate all the export files including:
- product-overview.md
- Milestone instructions (foundation + each section)
- one-shot-instructions.md (combined)
- Section READMEs
- Test instructions for each section
- Design system files
- Prompt templates
- Main README

## Step 5: Copy and Transform Components

### Shell Components
Copy from `src/shell/components/` to `product-plan/shell/components/`:
- Transform import paths from `@/...` to relative paths
- Remove Design OS-specific imports
- Ensure components are self-contained

### Section Components
For each section, copy from `src/sections/[section-id]/components/` to `product-plan/sections/[section-id]/components/`:
- Transform import paths
- Remove Design OS-specific imports
- Keep only exportable components (not preview wrappers)

## Step 6: Create Zip File

Create a zip archive:
```bash
rm -f product-plan.zip
cd . && zip -r product-plan.zip product-plan/
```

## Step 7: Confirm Completion

"I've created the complete export package at `product-plan/` and `product-plan.zip`.

**What's Included:**

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined
- `instructions/incremental/` — [N] milestone instructions

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, tokens
- `data-model/` — Entity types and sample data
- `shell/` — Application shell components
- `sections/` — [N] section component packages with test instructions

**Download:**
Restart your dev server and visit the Export page to download `product-plan.zip`.

**How to Use:**
1. Copy `product-plan/` to your implementation codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` or `prompts/section-prompt.md`
3. Add any additional notes, then copy/paste into your coding agent
4. Answer the agent's clarifying questions about auth, data modeling, etc.
5. Let the agent implement based on the instructions

The components are props-based and portable — they accept data and callbacks, letting your implementation agent handle routing, data fetching, and state management however fits your stack."

## Important Notes

- Always transform import paths when copying components
- Include `product-overview.md` context with every implementation session
- Use the pre-written prompts — they prompt for important clarifying questions
- Screenshots provide visual reference for fidelity checking
- The export is self-contained — no dependencies on Design OS
- Components are portable — they work with any React setup
