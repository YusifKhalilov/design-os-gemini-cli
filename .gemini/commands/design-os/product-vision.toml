# Product Vision

You are helping the user define their product vision for Design OS. This is a conversational, multi-step process.

## Step 1: Gather Initial Input

First, ask the user to share their raw notes, ideas, or thoughts about the product they want to build. Be warm and open-ended:

"I'd love to help you define your product vision. Tell me about the product you're building - share any notes, ideas, or rough thoughts you have. What problem are you trying to solve? Who is it for? Don't worry about structure yet, just share what's on your mind."

Wait for their response before proceeding.

## Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions

After receiving their input, follow the **Questioning & Data Gathering** guidelines in `agents.md`: Use reasoning, number your questions, and provide A/B/C options for each.

Ask 3-5 targeted questions to help shape:
- **The product name** (if missing, ask "Reasoning: Every product needs a unique identity and a label for documentation. 1. What would you like to call this product? A. [Suggestion 1] B. [Suggestion 2] C. Other (please specify)")
- **The core product description**
- **The key problems** & **solutions**
- **The main features**

**Example Reasoning & Questions:**
> "Reasoning: To build a solid foundation, I need to understand who we are building for and what the core value proposition is.
>
> 1. Who is the primary user of this product?
> A. Casual users/Consumers
> B. Professionals/B2B
> C. Internal team members
>
> 2. What's the single biggest pain point you're addressing?
> A. Manual, repetitive tasks (Efficiency)
> B. Lack of centralized data (Organization)
> C. High cost of existing solutions (Affordability)"

Ask questions one or two at a time.

## Step 3: Present Draft and Refine

Once you have enough information, present a draft summary:

"Based on our discussion, here's what I'm capturing for **[Product Name]**:

**Description:**
[Draft 1-3 sentence description]

**Problems & Solutions:**
1. [Problem] → [Solution]
2. [Problem] → [Solution]

**Key Features:**
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

Does this capture your vision? Would you like to adjust anything?"

Iterate until the user is satisfied.

## Step 4: Create the File

Once the user approves, create the file at `/product/product-overview.md` with this exact format:

# [Product Name]

## Description
[The finalized 1-3 sentence description]

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: [Problem Title]
[How the product solves it in 1-2 sentences]

### Problem 2: [Problem Title]
[How the product solves it in 1-2 sentences]

[Add more as needed, up to 5]

## Key Features
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
[Add more as needed]

**Important:** The `# [Product Name]` heading at the top is required - this is what displays as the card title in the app.

## Step 5: Confirm Completion

Let the user know:

"I've created your product overview at `/product/product-overview.md`. The homepage will now display **[Product Name]** with your product vision. You can run `/design-os:product-roadmap` next to break this down into development sections."

## Important Notes

- Be conversational and helpful, not robotic
- Ask follow-up questions when answers are vague
- Help the user think through their product, don't just transcribe
- Keep the final output concise and clear
- The format must match exactly for the app to parse it correctly
- **Always ensure the product has a name** - if user didn't provide one, ask for it
