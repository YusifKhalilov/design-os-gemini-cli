# Screenshot Screen Design

You are helping the user capture a screenshot of a screen design they've created. The screenshot will be saved to the product folder for documentation purposes.

## Step 1: Identify the Screen Design

First, determine which screen design to screenshot.

Read `/product/product-roadmap.md` to get the list of available sections, then check `src/sections/` to see what screen designs exist.

If only one screen design exists across all sections, auto-select it.

If multiple screen designs exist, ask which one to screenshot:

"Which screen design would you like to screenshot?"

Present the available screen designs as options, grouped by section:
- [Section Name] / [ScreenDesignName]
- [Section Name] / [ScreenDesignName]

## Step 2: Start the Dev Server

Start the dev server yourself using Bash. Run `npm run dev` in the background so you can continue with the screenshot capture.

Do NOT ask the user if the server is running or tell them to start it. You must start it yourself.

After starting the server, wait a few seconds for it to be ready before navigating to the screen design URL.

## Step 3: Capture the Screenshot

Use browser automation to navigate to the screen design and capture a screenshot.

The screen design URL pattern is: `http://localhost:3000/sections/[section-id]/screen-designs/[screen-design-name]`

1. First, navigate to the screen design URL
2. Wait for the page to fully load
3. **Click the "Hide" link** in the navigation bar to hide it before taking the screenshot
4. Capture the screenshot (without the navigation bar)

**Screenshot specifications:**
- Capture at desktop viewport width (1280px recommended)
- Use **full page screenshot** to capture the entire scrollable content
- PNG format for best quality

## Step 4: Save the Screenshot

Save the screenshot to the product folder:

```bash
cp [screenshot-file] product/sections/[section-id]/[filename].png
```

**Naming convention:** `[screen-design-name]-[variant].png`

Examples:
- `invoice-list.png` (main view)
- `invoice-list-dark.png` (dark mode variant)
- `invoice-detail.png`
- `invoice-form-empty.png` (empty state)

If the user wants both light and dark mode screenshots, capture both.

## Step 5: Confirm Completion

"I've saved the screenshot to `product/sections/[section-id]/[filename].png`.

The screenshot captures the **[ScreenDesignName]** screen design for the **[Section Title]** section."

If they want additional screenshots:

"Would you like me to capture any additional screenshots? For example:
- Dark mode version
- Mobile viewport
- Different states (empty, loading, etc.)"

## Important Notes

- Start the dev server yourself - do not ask the user to do it
- Screenshots are saved to `product/sections/[section-id]/` alongside spec.md and data.json
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the screen design and any variant
- Capture at a consistent viewport width for documentation consistency
- Always capture full page screenshots to include all scrollable content
- After you're done, you may kill the dev server if you started it
